Generator Installation
======================
    ./configure --prefix="/usr/local" --enable-svgalib      (SVGALIB version)
                                      --enable-allegro      (ALLEGRO version)
                                      --enable-tcltk        (TCL/TK version)
    (edit ../hdr/config.h, e.g. set #define PROCESSOR_INTEL)
    make
    cd ../src
    ./generator

In practice you will have to type some more...

Tcl/tk version
==============
  ... For example, there is no 'make install', so the above will assume
  that the files contained in the 'share' directory are located at
  '/usr/local/share/generator'.

  Note that since there are still functions that generator doesn't support,
  you may find your game sounds horrible because of the printing of information
  to the screen, which seriously slows the process down.  If this occurs you
  can fix this by adding '>/dev/null' to the end of the command.

All versions on Intel
=====================
  Following the above procedure will compile the platform independant Z80
  code written by Edward Massey.  There is an i386 object file compiled from
  the mz80 assembler version written by Neil Bradley in the .extra directory.

  If you are using an i386 processor (Pentium I, II, III etc) then I strongly
  advise you do the following, AFTER following the compilation procedure
  above:

    cd src
    cp .extra/z80.o.elfmz80 obj/z80/z80.o  (overwriting the file already there)
    make

  This z80 emulation has much better timing, which means that games sound a lot
  better, plus you get the added speed that comes from an assembler version.

Allegro cross-compilation
=========================
  Assuming you have setup djgpp and allegro in cross-compilation mode, you
  should be able to do:

    PATH=/usr/i586-pc-msdosdjgpp/bin ./configure --enable-allegro
    PATH=/usr/i586-pc-msdosdjgpp/bin make
