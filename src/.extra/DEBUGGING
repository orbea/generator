Debugging
-=-=-=-=-

There are quite a few debugging options - but to get them, you need
to edit the source, specifically:

gen68k.c:  int DEBUG_BRANCH = 0;
gen68k.c:  int DEBUG_SR = 0;
gen68k.c:  int DEBUG_RTE = 0;

and

vdp.c:#undef DEBUG_VDP
vdp.c:#undef DEBUG_VDPDMA
vdp.c:#undef DEBUG_VDPDATA

and

mem68k.c:#undef DEBUG_BUS
mem68k.c:#undef DEBUG_SRAM
mem68k.c:#undef DEBUG_RAM
mem68k.c:#undef DEBUG_UNIMPL

and

generator.c:unsigned int gen_debugmode = 0;

Note that the last one is passed along to the gen.tcl script, and hence
all the user interface debugging facilities are enabled.  gen68k.c is the
generating C source, so editing the DEBUG options means it'll have to
create new C source files and recompile them... <yawn>.  The DEBUG_xxx flags
just print stuff to stdout, so they're not too interesting.

If you're doing any debug at all, you'll want to enable DEBUG_UNIMPL, I
added it just before releasing this source because I felt that I should try
and print out nothing whilst attempting to run a game - most of the warnings
are rather important if a game uses an unimplemented memory access!
