                  the end rather than the start
         [CORE]   Changed everything to default to /usr/local and changed lib
                  to be share.

                  processing (fixes sonic water levels, outrun)

                  (altered beast)

                  copies are not blocked but truncated instead
         [VDP]    Completely reworked the complex VDP sprite plotter, and

         [VDP]    Fixed control port not doing 'F' flag correctly (pacman2,

                  from ages ago.  Simplest speed up of all times :)
         [UI]     Added vsync toggle to svgalib interface - this results in

         [VDP]    Fixed vdp fill bug when increment 2 on even addresses
         [VDP]    Fixed write to vdp after dma thinking it's a fill (T2)
         [VDP]    Re-worked the interrupt processing again (which breaks Out
                  Run, but fixes Asterix and improves the Sonic water levels)
         [VDP]    Fixed vdp dma to be banked (never seen this used)
         [VDP]    Fixed bug in complex vertical scrolling (air diver)
         [VDP]    Bodged together enough support for H counter reading to work
                  for '3 Ninjas Kick Back' (authors of which should be shot).
